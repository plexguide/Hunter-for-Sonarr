                <h2>System Settings</h2>
                <p>These settings control basic functionality and appearance of your Huntarr.io instance.</p>
                
                <h3 id="check-for-updates">Check for Updates</h3>
                <p>When enabled, Huntarr will automatically check for new versions and notify you when updates are available.</p>
                
                <p>We recommend keeping this enabled to ensure you're running the latest version with bug fixes and new features. Updates are not installed automatically; you'll just be notified when they're available.</p>
                
                <p>Disabling this option means you'll need to manually check for updates, which could lead to missing important security fixes or helpful new features. Most users should leave this enabled unless running Huntarr in an air-gapped environment.</p>
                
                <h3 id="debug-mode">Debug Mode</h3>
                <p>Enables verbose logging for troubleshooting issues. This setting applies to all apps connected to Huntarr.</p>
                
                <p>Only enable this when you're experiencing issues and need to troubleshoot or when requested by support. Debug mode generates more detailed logs that can help identify problems, but it can also increase disk usage and slightly reduce performance.</p>
                
                <p>When troubleshooting, enable this setting, reproduce the issue you're experiencing, then check the logs for detailed information. After resolving the issue, remember to disable debug mode to restore optimal performance.</p>
                
                <h3 id="display-resources">Display Resources</h3>
                <p>Controls whether the Resources section is shown on the home page.</p>
                
                <p>The Resources section displays helpful links like documentation, GitHub repository, and community forums. You may want to hide this once you're familiar with Huntarr to optimize screen space.</p>
                
                <p>New users should keep this enabled as it provides quick access to documentation and support resources. More experienced users might prefer to hide this section to focus on the core functionality of Huntarr.</p>

            <section id="stateful-management">
                <h2>Stateful Management</h2>
                <p>These settings control how Huntarr manages the state of processed media. Understanding these settings is crucial for proper operation of Huntarr's media processing capabilities.</p>
                
                <h3 id="emergency-reset">🔥 EMERGENCY RESET 🔥</h3>
                <p>This button immediately resets all processed media state information.</p>
                
                <p>Use this only in emergency situations where you need to force Huntarr to reprocess all media. This will clear all records of what media has been processed, allowing Huntarr to start fresh. This does not delete your media files or configuration settings.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> After reset, Huntarr may reprocess media that was already processed before, potentially causing duplicate downloads.</p>
                
                <p>Situations where an emergency reset might be necessary include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After changing your media organization strategy and wanting Huntarr to reevaluate all content</li>
                    <li>When you suspect that Huntarr's processing data has become corrupted</li>
                    <li>After a significant configuration change when you want Huntarr to start fresh</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Initial State Created:</strong> Sun, May 18, 2025, 02:45 PM (today)<br>
                <strong>State Reset Date:</strong> Sun, May 25, 2025, 02:45 PM (in 7 days)</p>
                
                <h3 id="state-reset-hours">State Reset (Hours)</h3>
                <p>Determines how many hours before automatically resetting processed media state information (default: 168 hours, or 7 days).</p>
                
                <p>This setting controls how long Huntarr remembers which media files it has already processed. After this time, Huntarr will "forget" what it has processed, allowing reprocessing of media.</p>
                
                <p>Increasing this value means Huntarr will remember processed media for longer, reducing the chance of duplicate processing. Decreasing it allows more frequent reprocessing of media, which might be useful if you often make changes to your media library or configuration.</p>
                
                <p>Common settings values and their effects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>168 hours (7 days):</strong> Default setting, suitable for most users</li>
                    <li><strong>720 hours (30 days):</strong> Good for stable setups where you rarely add new content</li>
                    <li><strong>72 hours (3 days):</strong> For more active libraries with frequent changes</li>
                    <li><strong>24 hours (1 day):</strong> For very dynamic environments or testing setups</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Reset clears all processed media IDs to allow reprocessing. This is especially useful when you've made changes to your naming conventions or organization structure and want Huntarr to reprocess content according to the new rules.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="security">
                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>These settings control access security and encryption options to protect your Huntarr installation.</p>
                
                <h3 id="authentication-mode">Authentication Mode</h3>
                <p>Controls how users authenticate with Huntarr. There are three options available:</p>
                
                <h4>Login Mode</h4>
                <p>Standard login required for all connections. This is the most secure option and is recommended if your Huntarr instance is accessible from the internet. With this mode, anyone accessing Huntarr will need to provide valid credentials.</p>
                
                <h4>Local Bypass Mode</h4>
                <p>Only local network connections (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) bypass login. This is convenient for home networks as it doesn't require login when accessing from your local network, but still requires login when accessing remotely.</p>
                
                <p>This mode offers a good balance between security and convenience for typical home setups. You won't need to log in when accessing Huntarr from devices on your home network, but external access will still require authentication.</p>
                
                <h4>No Login Mode</h4>
                <p>Completely disable authentication when running behind your own reverse proxy. Only use this if your instance is behind a secure reverse proxy (like Nginx or Cloudflare) that handles authentication for you.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Using "No Login Mode" without proper security could allow unauthorized access to your media and system! Only use this mode if you have implemented alternative security measures.</p>
                
                <h3 id="enable-ssl-verify">Enable SSL Verify</h3>
                <p>Controls whether Huntarr verifies SSL certificates when connecting to other services.</p>
                
                <p>Normally, this should be enabled for security. It ensures Huntarr only connects to services with valid SSL certificates, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized access.</p>
                
                <p>You might need to disable this if you're using self-signed certificates on your private network. For example, if you have self-signed certificates for Sonarr, Radarr, or other services, Huntarr might not be able to connect to them unless this is disabled.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Only disable this on private, trusted networks. Disabling SSL verification on public networks or internet-facing installations could expose your system to security risks.</p>
                
                <p>If you're experiencing connection issues with other services that use SSL, and you're using self-signed certificates or a private certificate authority, you may need to disable this option. However, a better approach would be to properly configure your certificates to be trusted by your system.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="advanced-settings">
                <h2>Advanced Settings</h2>
                <p>These settings are for advanced users who need to fine-tune Huntarr's performance and behavior. Adjust these settings only if you understand their impact on the system.</p>
                
                <h3 id="api-timeout">API Timeout</h3>
                <p>The number of seconds Huntarr will wait for API responses before timing out (default: 120 seconds).</p>
                
                <p>If you notice Huntarr frequently reporting timeouts when connecting to Sonarr, Radarr, or other services, you might need to increase this value. This is especially useful on slower networks or when services are under heavy load.</p>
                
                <p>However, setting this too high could cause Huntarr to appear unresponsive if a service is down, as it will wait longer before giving up on connections.</p>
                
                <p>This setting is particularly important if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have services running on slower hardware like a Raspberry Pi</li>
                    <li>Your services are handling large libraries or running intensive tasks</li>
                    <li>Your network has higher latency or occasional connectivity issues</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 id="command-wait-delay">Command Wait Delay</h3>
                <p>The delay in seconds between command status checks (default: 1 second).</p>
                
                <p>This setting controls how frequently Huntarr checks if a command sent to another service (like Sonarr or Radarr) has completed. Lower values make Huntarr more responsive but might increase network traffic. Higher values reduce network traffic but might make Huntarr seem less responsive.</p>
                
                <p>The default of 1 second works well for most users and shouldn't need changing. In high-performance environments with many services, increasing this value slightly (to 2-3 seconds) might reduce unnecessary network traffic without significantly impacting responsiveness.</p>
                
                <h3 id="cmd-wait-attempts">CMD Wait Attempts</h3>
                <p>The maximum number of attempts to check command status (default: 600).</p>
                
                <p>This setting, combined with Command Wait Delay, determines how long Huntarr will wait for a command to complete before giving up. With default settings (600 attempts × 1 second delay), Huntarr will wait up to 10 minutes.</p>
                
                <p>If you're processing very large libraries or have slower systems, you might need to increase this value. If commands are typically quick on your system, you could decrease it to detect failed commands more quickly.</p>
                
                <p>Calculation: Total wait time = Command Wait Delay × CMD Wait Attempts</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Default: 1 second × 600 attempts = 600 seconds (10 minutes)</li>
                    <li>For slower systems: 1 second × 1200 attempts = 1200 seconds (20 minutes)</li>
                    <li>For faster systems: 1 second × 300 attempts = 300 seconds (5 minutes)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 id="max-dl-queue-size">Max DL Queue Size</h3>
                <p>If the current download queue for an app instance exceeds this value, downloads will be skipped until the queue reduces (default: -1, which means no limit).</p>
                
                <p>This setting helps prevent overwhelming your download client with too many simultaneous downloads. If you notice performance issues when Huntarr triggers many downloads at once, you might want to set this to a reasonable value (like 5 or 10).</p>
                
                <p>Setting this to -1 means there's no limit on how many downloads Huntarr will queue, which can be useful if you have a very powerful system and fast internet.</p>
                
                <p>Consider your bandwidth and system resources when setting this value:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>-1 (No limit):</strong> For high-bandwidth connections and powerful systems</li>
                    <li><strong>10-15:</strong> For good broadband connections and moderately powerful systems</li>
                    <li><strong>5-10:</strong> For typical home broadband connections</li>
                    <li><strong>1-5:</strong> For slower connections or systems with limited resources</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 id="log-refresh-interval">Log Refresh Interval</h3>
                <p>How often Huntarr refreshes logs from apps, in seconds (default: 30 seconds).</p>
                
                <p>This setting controls how frequently Huntarr updates the logs you see in the UI. Lower values (like 10-15 seconds) make logs update more frequently but might increase system load. Higher values (like 60 seconds) reduce system load but make logs less current.</p>
                
                <p>The default of 30 seconds provides a good balance between timely updates and system efficiency. If you're actively troubleshooting an issue and need to see log updates more quickly, you might temporarily reduce this value. For regular operation, especially on less powerful hardware, keeping it at 30 seconds or higher is recommended.</p>
                
                <p>When adjusting this setting, consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>10-15 seconds:</strong> For active troubleshooting when you need near real-time log updates</li>
                    <li><strong>30 seconds:</strong> Default, good balance for most users</li>
                    <li><strong>60 seconds:</strong> For systems with limited resources or when logs aren't frequently needed</li>
                </ul>
